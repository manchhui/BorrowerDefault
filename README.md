# BorrowerDefault
Udemy Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp - Final Project

## Abstract / Introduction
The best "f1_score" for "class 0" of 66% was acheieved using an "Artifical Neural Network" (ANN) with random oversampling of the dataset, to mitigate against the clear imbalances in the dataset. However by focusing the predictive power of the model on the "f1_score" for "class 0" there has been compromises in the performance of the model in other areas. However as the objective of this project was focused on predicting borrower defaults, such a compromises is considered acceptable.
